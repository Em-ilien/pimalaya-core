## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `vendored` cargo feature.

  The feature is forwarded to `keyring-rs` in order to pack OpenSSL lib with this crate.

### Changed

- Renamed cargo features:
  - `keyring-tokio` has been splitted into `keyring`, `tokio` and `rustls` features
  - `keyring-tokio-openssl` has been splitted into `keyring`, `tokio` and `openssl` features
  - `keyring-async-io` has been splitted into `keyring`, `async-std` and `rustls` features
  - `keyring-async-io-openssl` has been splitted into `keyring`, `async-std` and `openssl` features
- Replaced `log` by `tracing`.
- Renamed `Secret::Undefined` with `Secret::Empty`.
- Renamed `Secret::is_undefined` with `Secret::is_empty`.
- Renamed `Secret::set_only_keyring` with `Secret::set_if_keyring`.
- Renamed `Secret::delete_only_keyring` with `Secret::delete_if_keyring`.
- Renamed `Secret::KeyringEntry` with `Secret::Keyring`.
- Changed `Secret::replace_undefined_to_keyring` with `Secret::replace_if_empty`.

  This function became more generic. It takes now a new `Secret` as argument instead of a keyring entry.
